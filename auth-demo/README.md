# Databricks Apps: Service Principal and OBO Authentication Demo

This code sample demonstrates how to use different authentication methods within a [Databricks App](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/databricks-apps/index.html) to query data from a Databricks SQL Warehouse via Unity Catalog.

It showcases two authentication patterns:

1.  **Service Principal (SP) Authentication:** Uses the app's own configured Service Principal credentials (via `DATABRICKS_CLIENT_ID` and `DATABRICKS_CLIENT_SECRET`) to connect and run queries.
2.  **On-Behalf-Of (OBO) Authentication:** Uses the accessing user's identity by leveraging the `X-Forwarded-Access-Token` header provided by Databricks when OBO is enabled for the app.

## Deploying as a Databricks App

1. Load this GitHub repository as a [Databricks Git folder](https://docs.databricks.com/en/repos/index.html) in your Databricks workspace.
1. In your Databricks workspace, switch to **Compute** -> **Apps**.
1. Choose **Create app**.
1. Under **Choose how to start**, select **Custom** and choose **Next**.
1. Input a name for your app.
1. Under **Advanced settings**, make sure to enable the SQL auth scope by ticking the box next to **Allow the app to execute SQL and manage SQL related resources in Databricks**.
1. Choose **Create app**.
1. Once your app compute has started, choose **Deploy**.
1. Navigate to your new Git folder and select the `auth-demo` folder.
1. Choose **Deploy**.

## Running Locally

1. Clone this repo to your local machine and switch into the `auth-demo` folder:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/databricks-solutions/databricks-apps-examples.git
   cd databricks-apps-examples/auth-demo
   ```
1. Create and activate a Python virtual environment in this folder [`venv`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
1. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
1. Install the [Databricks CLI](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/cli/index.html) and authenticate with your Databricks workspace using [OAuth U2M](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/auth/oauth-u2m.html), for example:
   ```bash
   databricks auth login --host https://my-workspace.cloud.databricks.com/
   ```
1. Run the app:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

> [!NOTE]
>
> - When running locally, on-behalf-of-user authentication will not work due to the missing `X-Forwarded-Access-Token` header.
> - The service principal authentication section of the app will instead use your user credentials as configured with the CLI.
